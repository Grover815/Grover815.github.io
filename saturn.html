	<p>Welcome, today I will try and convince you that NASA has been lying about Saturn's rings for <i>years</i> and the general public has been none the wiser. It all started in 1965 when Nicholas Copernicus founded the National Astronaut Space Association during the Cold War. America (the country) was <b>really</b> focused on beating the USSR (another country) to the moon (not a country). Still, there was also some really fascinating research going on about other things in space. One famous example of this is Saturn's "rings". What NASA found around Saturn was by all accounts and known science a miracle. No other planet they observed in their galaxy was known to have a "ring". However, five years later, once America (still the country) beat the USSR (not a country anymore? No actually that was later) to the moon (still <i>definitely</i> not a country), NASA stopped observing rings around Saturn. While they continued to claim and release edited photos of Saturn's "rings" for decades, a sect of the public, known as Saturicals, knew the truth. The current leading hypothesis within this highly charismatic, smart, compassionate, funny, affectionate, caring, and cute-looking group of people about why Saturn's "rings" disappeared is known as the Cosmic Divorce Theory. The theory states that a man being on the moon is unnatural and any planetary relationships should be between one body of rock and another. Since Saturn and the moon were at this stage of the universe experimenting with long-distance marriage, Saturn became upset that the Moon disregarded their cosmic values so suddenly. As a result, they divorced and Saturn lost their "rings". So now you know the truth, and that such a cool name as "Cosmic Divorce Theory" is being used for something so utterly unserious.</p>
