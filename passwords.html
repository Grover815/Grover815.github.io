	<p>Did you really think I was that dumb? The sheer level of incomptence required to publicly make my passwords to all my important accounts available would be astronomical. If I was really going to put my passwords on this website, I'd put them at a URL that didn't literally have passwords in the title. It would have to be named something random, unpredictable like <a href="pineapple.html">pineapple</a> or <a href="saturn.html">saturn</a>.</p>
